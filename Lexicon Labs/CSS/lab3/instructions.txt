	----Bootstrap Grid Lab----

1.	There are 2 files in this folder. The grid_example.html is the one i showed you in the meeting.
	Open it in the browser and choose inspect and hover over each row/column and try to understand it.
	Or simply use it as a helper file. 


2. 	Open index.html by a dubble click to read the instructions of the Coffe Lover Project.
3. 	Open the index.html in Visual Studio Code to edit the code and finish the Lab.

	Good Luck and dont hesitate to ask any questions you might have to Haithem or Sowjanya.
